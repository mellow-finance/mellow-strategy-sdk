Mellow Strategy SDK
===============================================

Mellow Stratedy SDK is a set of tools for defining custom strategies 
and backtesting them on real `Uniswap V3 <https://uniswap.org/whitepaper-v3.pdf>`_ data in just a few steps.

Currently the data is available for the following pools:

- WBTC / WETH 0.3%
- USDC / WETH 0.3%
- USDC / USDT  0.05%

The SDK is assumed to be used in Jupyter notebooks and optimized for displaying 
and working data in a form of `Pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`_ Dataframes and Series.

To start using the SDK see :ref:`Getting Started`.
